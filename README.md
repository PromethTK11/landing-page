# landing-page
This is my first web page project made with CSS and HTML.  
It is part of The Odin Project Curriculum.  
You only get an image to work with, and the end result should look like this:  
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png 

So, in the end, the page that I made was similar, but with small touches.
